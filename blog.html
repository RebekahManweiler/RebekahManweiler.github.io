		<p> Today I went on my first lab tour with the PREP students to the Bennett Lab. Professor Bennett does research in Comparitive Psychology with animals like apes and monkeys.
		To my surprise, the Universtiy of Wisconsin has one of few Primate Research Centers in the country and for part of our lab tour we got to go see Marmoset Monkeys! One facsinating 
		thing I remember learning from the tour was that groups of Marmosets only have one pair of reproductive parents, meaning that all of the group members besides the highest ranking 
		male and female turn off their reproductive processes and the whole group helps to raise the babies. When the babies are first born, they cling onto the back or the neck of the father 
		and are so small that it is almost impossible to spot them. I though it was a truly amazing experience and had never seen anything like it.</p>

		<h5> Summary of my second week <span class="w3-opacity">May 28 - June 1, 2018</span></h5>
	  </div>
	  <div class="w3-container">
	  <p> This week I read a lot of papers. It was pretty much the only thing I could do since the database on the lab server wasn't ready for me to access yet, 
	  so I participated in our second reading group (paper linked below), I read the Base Challenge project description that Professor Beckage and Professor Austerweil 
	  were given in January, and I was given more papers to read on different mathematical models. The Base Challenge project description contained information about how 
	  the challenge works, what data they are given, the tests that will be used to 'grade' each team's model(s), as well as approximately 30 different questions that 
	  could be asked of the model to predict or exaplain. My task this week was to narrow down this list of 30 questions to a list of 5-7 that I could focus on in 
	  my model. My questions and focus are explained in my working proposal document which is linked below. Next week may be difficult because both Professor Beckage 
	  and Professor Austerweil will be gone for a portion of it, but we will do the best we can to keep in touch and work on any problems I have with the database.</p>

	  The PREP students arrived today and I will be meeting them tomorrow morning during breakfast! I am excited to meet some new people and maybe make some friends.</p>

	  <p> I am so glad that I was able to bring my bike with me up to Madison. It is so easy to get around!
	  Madison has several different bike paths around the lake and through the city, and there is usually
	  a designated bike lane in all the streets as well. So, today I decided to go up to campus on my bike and look around.
	  I found the Psychology building, the Memorial Union Terrace, and several shops at the East Campus Mall. Above are
	  pictures of some of the buildings around campus and the view from the terrace of lake Mendota.</p>

	  <p> I arrived in Madison Wisconsin at my new home away from home late in the evening on May 18.
	  I spent that first weekend getting situated in the house and getting familiar with my neighboorhood, campus, and around the capitol.
	  Madison is so lively and the lake (which is two blocks away from the house) is beautiful.
	  The first day in the lab I met all the graduate students, post-docs, and professors in Professor Austerweil's
	  lab and some of us went out to lunch together. The rest of the week in the lab was spent getting my computer fixed at IT, 
	  downloading software, participating in the lab reading group, and reading papers for my lit review. Overall I think it has been a good first week, and next week I should
	  get more familiar with my project and get connected to the lab server.</p>
