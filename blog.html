		<p> My last week. Looking back on it now, it wasn't really as busy as I felt it was. I felt like I never had a 
		spare moment to think, and that's because I never stopped thinking! I ended up meeting with Nicole one last time 
		to ask how I should compare my models and for her to give the final OK on my presentation. There were only a few things 
		she suggested I change and those were the last few slides having to do with my results and whatnot, so it wasn't a 
		big deal. I also met with a bunch of people this week as Nicole suggested, to get any last pieces of advice before I 
		leave and to get contact information (if I hadn't already) so I could stay in touch. I met with Joe, Professor Saffran, Xian, 
		Jeff, and a few others from the lab and had a really nice dinner with Nicole. I gave my presentation titled "Adding Cognition 
		to GitHub" on Thursday the 2nd and I think it went really well. I got several compliments afterwards and a few questions, and 
		I went to the PREP party hosted by Professor Postle where everyone got to eat great food, have a few drinks, and talk about 
		the summer. It felt so nice to be done, and it was fun talking with everyone and taking pictures, but it was also kind of sad. 
		It was hard to believe that the summer was over and that we had all spent 10 weeks with each other. I left Madison Friday 
		afternoon and decided to stay with my aunt and uncle again for a couple days before I went back to Kansas.</p>
		<p> I will be forever grateful to Nicole, Joe, Professor Postle, Jackie, all of the people in my lab, and all the PREP students 
		for making this summer one of the best I've had in a long time. My time in Madison has changed my trajectory and my thinking 
        and probably my future for the better. I know for a fact that it would have been a terrible loss for me had I decided two and 
		a half months ago that I would stay home and work. There are so many people that I would have missed the opportunity to meet 
		and so many opportunities that I would have never known of. If anyone is reading this and trying to decide if they should apply 
		for the DREU program: DO IT. It could change your life, and you with it if you give yourself the chance.</p>

		<p> These weeks just keep getting busier and busier! This week I participated in two different conferences and 
		worked with Nicole on getting three different models up on my computer as examples for me to use to make my own. 
		It was extremely helpful to sit down and work with her one-on-one to get the models up. We worked through bugs,
		talked about some potential hypothesis I could look into with my data and help me understand what I was doing 
		wrong with the linear model last week. We also talked about what I can use to help visualize my results when I 
		get there, general advice for graduate school, and something that has been on my mind for a while which is 
		whether or not I should take a year off before I go to graduate school. She said that I should only do that if 
		I really need to and only if I get some sort of research aid or lab manager position. Her advice was very helpful 
		and it was nice to have a good long conversation with her about everything on my mind. I really don't know what I 
		would do without her guidance, and I know for a fact that I wouldn't be here in Madison without her. The next day 
		I was able to sit down and decide what I wanted to ask about my data. I came up with a couple different hypotheses, 
		chose one to start with, and was able to get working models to answer my question. My only problem now is that I'm not 
		entirely sure how to compare them. I have two confusion matrices and lots of statistics I can calculate from them, but 
		I don't know which I should use for my presentation. Hopefully, next week I will be able to meet with Nicole again and 
		get some more advise.</p>

	    <h3><b>CogSci 2018 </b></h3>
		<h5>Attending the CogSci Conference <span class="w3-opacity">July 25 - 27, 2018</span></h5>
	  </div>
	  <div class="w3-container">
		<p> Not only did I get to attend MathPsych this week, but I also got to attend CogSci! For three 
		days I attended workshops, talks, and symposiums about sever different topics within cognitive science, 
		and here I will mention a few that I felt were the best. First was the all-day workshop I attended on 
		Learning as Program Induction. Program induction is when a program (or function) writes another program(function). 
		I have always thought of this idea as a bit weird, but I liked using it as a metaphor for learning. The talks on 
		this subject were all very interesting, but some of them were much too technical for me to follow and understand. 
		The next were some short research talks during a session called Emerging Language. All of the talks were very well 
		done and extremely interesting to me. In particular, there was one talk about linguistic accommodation made when 
		speaking to foreigners and how it can lead to language simplification in extreme contexts. I asked if they were thinking 
		of using a similar model to represent child directed speech and to understand how it changes over time, and the speaker 
		told us that they are currently working on those kinds of questions. The last one I will mention here was a set of talks 
		by invited speakers on false news. Many interesting subsets of this topic were discussed including how false information 
		may manifest and how to prevent it, the role of information bias in making individual's views more extreme, the role of 
		curiosity and intelligence in the spread of false news, the ability to distinguish false news from real news on social 
		media, and a comparison of two different theories (models) of how and by whom false information is spread. These talks 
		were so amazing and inspiring that I considered changing my own field of research! This topic is fascinating to me anyway, 
		but the work they did, and the conclusions they found were so interesting that I couldn't help but imagine myself doing 
		the same thing in graduate school.</p>
		<p> All said and done, I am so thankful that I got to go to CogSci. I really enjoyed myself and during the poster session 
		on the last day of the conference I got the chance to meet Professor Feldman! I feel so lucky that CogSci was in Madison 
		this summer and hopefully I will get the chance to go again next summer.</p>

	    <h3><b>MathPsych 2018 </b></h3>
		<h5>Volunteering at the MathPsych Conference <span class="w3-opacity">July 23, 2018</span></h5>
	  </div>
	  <div class="w3-container">
		<p> Today I volunteered at the MathPsych Conference. There wasn't very much that the organizers needed 
		help with so I got to enjoy myself and attend the talks. There were several that I enjoyed, but the one 
		I enjoyed the most was a talk by Professor Naomi Feldman from the University of Maryland. Her talk, titled: 
		From Real to Idea: How Listeners Cope with Variable Linguistic Input, discussed the existence of an input 
		filter that allows listeners to create an idealized input from the original speech stream. This filter was 
		modeled with a noisy channel model and was able to produce accurate representations of both vowel perception 
		(the perceptual magnet effect) and consonant discrimination (categorical perception) by only changing a single 
		variable. She discussed how children might use this filter while learning language to remove bad or unlikely 
		data from the speech signal. I think I enjoyed her talk so much because everything she proposed made sense. 
		Maybe the reason we misunderstand someone while they are speaking is because our filter created an incorrect 
		representation of what the speaker said, and why we find in some cases that we can still interpret what people 
		say when they mess up their speech. I am very interested to see if their model can be expanded, and if it could 
		help us understand how we parse a speech stream.</p>
		<p> I was hoping I would get the chance to meet Professor Feldman and ask her some questions about her talk and 
		her research, but it did not arise. One thing is certain in my mind, and that is I would like to work with her 
		some day.</p>

		<h5>Summary of my eighth week <span class="w3-opacity">July 16 - 20, 2018</span></h5>
	  </div>
	  <div class="w3-container">
		<p> This week I feel I've been on my A-game despite Nicole's absence! She is gone to participate in the DARPA challenge and I wish her and the team the best of luck! 
		As for me, the kmeans process from last week finished successfully over the weekend and I now have all of the data I need to create and run my own model! Since the variable 
		I am wanting to predict (which is the event type) is a categorical variable, I began looking for examples of models that predicted categories and found a page giving a 
		tutorial on how to create a linear binomial model to predict gender. I wasn't sure if it would be a problem that I had more than two categories, but I tried it anyway. 
		I've been working on it for most of the week and the model runs but I always end up getting a memory error. The trouble is that I know for a fact that I have plenty of 
		memory for the task to finish, so there has to be something else going on. For now I will be spending the weekend working on other things that need my attention like my 
		presentation and when Nicole gets back I will ask for her help. The one unfortunate thing about being so focused on my work is that I missed the reading group this week. 
		I really chastised myself for it because that was the second meeting I had missed in a row, so on Friday I was very conscious of myself and made sure I didn't miss the 
		lab meeting. Ironically, it was the shortest lab meeting we've had this summer. We were supposed to have one of the undergrad students practice presenting their research 
		talk for CogSci, but Joe told us they weren't feeling well and couldn't make it, and since there were no other announcements or discussions that was it. Besides those things, 
		I also went to the SROP Graduate School Resource Fair and talked to some representatives of different programs here at UW. Everyone I spoke with assured me that I would be 
		a good candidate for their program and encouraged me to apply which made me feel very confident and proud of my accomplishments. It's not every day that I feel proud of myself 
		and the things I have done, but this week was quite a bit of that, and it's probably why I've been working well this week. Lastly, the PREP manager, Jackie, sent me an 
		invitation to be in the group picture for their website. I was kind of surprised to be honest. I felt that I have been more of a guest in their program and don't want to 
		impose that I am a member just because I got funding from elsewhere and happened to be working in the same department over the summer. But, Jackie didn't seemed phased and 
		told me that I was part of the group. It still amazes me how generous these people are, and I am so lucky to have gotten the chance to work with them and get to know them.</p>

		<h5>Our eighth faculty presentation by Dr. Saffran <span class="w3-opacity">July 19, 2018</span></h5>
	  </div>
	  <div class="w3-container">
		<p> Today's faculty research talk was by Dr. Saffran where she gave a nice overview of what she studies in her lab. 
		Her main focus is on how children learn language, but her research and her graduate student's research can vary within 
		this field. The first thing she had us do together was make a list of things that people know about their native language 
		that they don't know about a foreign language. We made a good list including things like syntax, vocabulary, intonation, tone, 
		word frequency, word boundaries, pragmatics, phonetics, morphology, and phonology, and we discussed each. The reason we 
		made this list is because these are things we intuitively understand with our native language. It is a lot of information, and 
		some of this information are things that most people are not aware of either. So, how do children figure it all out so easily?
		Dr. Saffran believes it is largely due to infants' incredible perception of statistical patterns, of which natural language is 
		riddled with! Her example was a study she did in 1996 about how children identify word boundaries. They found that children 
		are very good a tracking the probabilities of different sound combinations and using those to infer breaks between words. This 
		paper was extremely influential in both Linguistics and Cognitive Science and has be cited hundreds of times. And, she and her 
		students continue to do influential work in the realm of first language acquisition with normal and abnormal developing children.</p>

		<p> This week's lab tour was of the Cognition In Action Lab run by Dr. Rosengren. Most of the focus in this lab is 
		the intersection of cognitive and motor development, for example one study in the lab looks at certain errors that 
		children make like when they try and fit their bodies into something too small or when they try to grab an image that 
		looks real from a book or even a tablet. Another is a study looking at the paper folding test: a method used in many 
		schools to test children's spacial reasoning skills. They hope to determine if this test is a good measure for 
		spacial reasoning and use the method to improve children's spacial reasoning. The last was a study on health and 
		illness in different cultures. This study looks at how children understand the common cold and the influence of their 
		parents and their culture in this understanding. The two groups they are working with currently are American families 
		and Latin American families. </p>

	  </div>
	  <div class="w3-container">
		<p> This week I was able to run the kmeans clustering analysis successfully! I used a few different 
		methods to determine the best number of clusters to use and decided that three clusters fit the data 
		best. In my three clusters, I found that the individual users were not separated from the organizations 
		in any of the clusters which is very interesting! If I could I would look to see if those individuals who 
		were included in the smaller cluster of mainly organizations represented an organization or if the 
		organizations that were included in the large group of mainly individual users were small startup companies.
		I think it would definitely be an interesting result, but I don't have a way to go back to the original data 
		and determine what kind of individual user or organization the users are. I also had a meeting with Joe early 
		on in the week. He asked me how my project was going and how I was doing, and I asked him about applying to 
		graduate schools. We talked for quite a while and he gave me a hefty list of names and schools to look into! 
		I certainly should start working on that list while I'm here while it's easy to find and discuss things with him and 
		with Nicole. I also met with Nicole this week where we talked about what I had found and what my next steps were.
		I made a new table that contains information from both the user and the event tables to see if I can combine 
		information about an event and its author and owner to predict the event type. So I started with the event table 
		and replaced the author id and owner id with their respective information from the user table. I also included 
		each user's kmeans cluster group as a source of 'cognitive' information about the user. I was able to create 
		the table, but because of how I ran the kmeans analysis I didn't have all of the users included in the event 
		table and subsequently was missing about half the events from the event table. Because of this, I decided to rerun 
		the kmeans analysis in a way that allowed me to include all of the users from the user table, and then 
		began the process of making the new table again. The process ran overnight and finished Saturday morning, so I 
		probably won't look at it until Monday of next week. Because of all my hard work on Friday, I accidentally missed 
		the lab meeting! I messaged Joe about it and he assured me it wasn't a big deal, but I still felt guilty about it. 
		I believe that there were MathPsych practice presentations that day and I hope they went well. </p>

	  <div class="w3-container">
		<p> For our seventh faculty talk, we learned about Dr. Saalmann's research in consciousness. He is interested 
		in how information in the brain is transmitted and more specifically how it flows through the thalamo-cortical 
		network, which is the network of pathways from areas like the frontal and parietal lobes to each other and 
		through the thalamus. They have found that the thalamus regulates the cortical activity and flow of information 
		in this network. They have also found that stimulation of the central thalamic region results in arousal when 
		under anesthesia. But is this merely arousal or is there also awareness? Dr. Saalmann hopes to continue to 
		investigate this question and more regarding the role of the thalamus in our conscious minds. This kind of research 
		is so interesting and I intend on following Dr. Saalmann's research to see the strides he and his students make 
		in this field.</p>

		<h5>Sixth Lab Tour - Saffran Lab <span class="w3-opacity">July 10, 2018</span></h5>
	  </div>
	  <div class="w3-container">
		<p> Yes this is technically supposed to be my fifth lab tour, but I missed the fifth one during my week off. So, to stay consistent 
		with the calendar this is the sixth lab tour. And what a marvelous one it was! We went up to the Infant Learning Lab run by Dr. Saffran. 
		In this lab they study how infants, toddlers, and young children learn language. They showed us several studies they conduct where we 
		got to interact with them as the children would. The first was a study looking at how children learn under unexpected conditions and if it 
		is different (possibly more novel, or more confusing) than under expected conditions. To clarify what I mean I will describe the study. Through 
		a video, a child sees a person with two novel objects (made from play dough) on their right and left, the person picks up one of the objects and 
		says something along the lines of "Look at this!" They continuously pick up this same object over and over again for a short time so that the child 
		would grow disinterested in it. Then the objects switch sides. The expected condition is for the person to pick up the same object that is on the opposite 
		side, and the unexpected condition is for them to pick up the other object. They then name the object and later test to see how well the child 
		learned the name of the object that was picked up using eye tracking. So, they are trying to determine if there is a difference between the two 
		learning conditions.</p>
		<p>The second study was about gender in the context of learning. They wish to know if the gender of the speaker influences how quickly children 
		identify objects. They have paired objects that are either colored neutrally in terms of gender, or one object is gendered towards girls and the other 
		towards boys. Then they have a male or female speaker ask the child to identify one of the objects. For the gendered pairs of objects, their hypothesis 
		is that children will find the object faster or before the object name is spoken if the gender of the speaker matches the gender of the object.</p>
		<p> The last study was about learning names of novel objects using priming. In this study, children are shown two pictures on a screen, one known object 
		and one novel object. They are asked to identify one of the objects. Even though they do not know the name of the novel object, since they know the name 
		of the familiar object they can easily identify which object is being asked for. In doing this they learn the names of the novel objects. The researchers 
		specifically pair some of the novel objects with toys and the others with food with the idea that when children learn a new word it will tend to be in 
		the context of words in a similar category. After the training period, originally the researchers asked the children which of the novel objects they could 
		eat. This method came with complications, for instance some children said they could eat both because they were made with play dough. So instead, the 
		researchers turned to a head turning task. The experiment set up included three different screens, a center, left, and right screen. The child would sit and 
		face the center screen watching an animated image. The image would then move to either the left or right screen and two words would be repeated. When the child 
		gets bored of the two words they turn their head away, and the image goes back to the center screen. The image would then move to the opposite screen and two 
		other words would be repeated. This method is repeated for about ten minutes, and the duration of one set of words is dictated by the child's interest in those 
		words (or their novelty). The idea is that two words like 'dog' and 'cat' said together will not hold a child's attention as long as two words that are not of 
		the same category like 'dog' and 'shoe'. This is how the researchers tested if the priming effect of grouped images in the first part of the study allowed the 
		children to learn those objects and group them in the same category as the other images they were presented with. I was skeptical at first that a child 
		would be able to pick up on this pattern because I didn't notice it myself, but the students assured me that children are much better at recognizing these 
		kinds of patterns than adults are and that their experiment has been successful in finding this behavioral effect. One of the reasonings behind this 
		is that children are more imaginative and more able to use the context of their surroundings to define or understand an object. </p>
		<p>If you can't tell I am extremely interested in these sorts of studies and I really enjoyed this lab tour. I am just utterly fascinated with the way children 
		learn language. They are just tiny little machines that aren't good at anything else except learning language. It is amazing to me, and I feel that even tiny 
		steps towards understanding how children are able to do this so easily will dramatically increase our knowledge of the brain and its structures as well as 
		improve our techniques of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. I think this would definitely be a feasible option for me as I look for graduate 
		schools and research opportunities.</p>

		some new research that he and one of his graduate students has been working on, and that one of the PREP 
		students, Yves, is helping them with. The project focuses on false beliefs and how they occur. He gave us 
		three reasons that someone may have a false belief: a lack of knowledge in a certain area, it is something that 
		aligns with their preferences, ideology, world view, or self image, or a third option given by cognitive psychology. 
		He continues by sidetracking to statistics for a moment. Our minds are optimal, statistical engines and when we 
		make predictions, generalizations, or inferences about something we have perceived and it is incorrect, it may lead 
		to a false belief. This is a valid reason for seemingly small beliefs or misconceptions, but what about larger ones? 
		Do larger scale beliefs occur in patterns? Can we expect coalitions of incorrect beliefs to co-occur? And if they 
		do, can we predict how susceptible someone is to a certain belief? These are the questions of their current research 
		where they use surveys of people from around the world to find patterns of beliefs. This was an extremely interesting 
		talk and I'm afraid we may have given Yves more work for the rest of the summer than he anticipated!</p>

		models from these representations that we should start by using a clustering algorithm that can give us our user groups based on the user data we have. One of the papers I read recently, 
		which I will link down below, did something similar in their study and so I decided to use the algorithm that they used which is the k-means clustering algorithm. This algorithm is 
		available in R so I will be doing some digging to find out how to run it and what packages I will need. I'm sure that there are many ways to do this, so I will have to work with Nicole 
		to find the best option for our data. There is one package that I know of called caret which allows users to select one of their supported machine learning algorithms and train, validate, and

		introductions (name, position in the lab [ie. undergrad, postdoc, ...], research interests [optional], and your favorite 
		introduction question [ie. favorite animal, hobby, weirdest experience, ...]), creating a schedule for the summer, and 
		talking about the conferences that will be hosted here at the end of July and beginning of August (MathPsych, CogSci, and eLucid). 
		Overall, it was a nice meeting and I am excited to be at the next one because two of the other undergrads will be giving

	    <h3><b>Faculty Talk No.4</b></h3>
		<h5>Our fourth faculty presentation by Dr. Rosengren <span class="w3-opacity">June 21, 2018</span></h5>
	  </div>
	  <div class="w3-container">
		<p> Today our fourth faculty presentation was given by Dr. Rosengren who is a lifespan developmental psychologist. Dr. 
		Rosengren began his discussion talking about his interesting journey through academia. He and his wife were originally both 
		professors, but his wife took a job within the administration at their first university (University of Minnesota if I am 
		remembering correctly). As his wife took jobs at different universities over the years, he was able to follow her and find 
		a place in every department he found himself in. He mentioned that in order to dispel any assumptions that he only got the 
		job because of his wife's position, Dr. Rosengren worked twice as hard as he needed to and proved his worth to the community 
		every single time. I really appreciated his story because it is not one that people see every day. He told us he felt it 
		important to use himself as an example because, even though we might want it to be, the road to (and through) academia is not 
		always a straight line. </p>
		<p> Professor Rosengren also told us about his research in child cognitive development. He is very interested in answering 
		questions like 'How do children think about the world?', 'How do they differentiate between the real world and fantasy?', 'What kinds of things do children believe are magical?',
		'How do children understand death?', 'How do parents communicate with their children about death?'. We spent quite a bit of 
		time in our discussion about how children understand death and how their culture and environment shapes their perspective on 
		death. Specifically, Rosengren has studied the difference between how Americans generally view death and how Mexicans view death.
		In America it is very common to shield children from death, especially the death of a family member, and often families do not 
		teach their children about death with the worry that it will scare them or that they will not be able to understand. On the 
		other hand, in Mexico it is common for families to talk about death. The Dia de Muertos (Day of the Dead) is a holiday beginning October 31 
		that is celebrated throughout Mexico. It is a celebration of those who have died, where the people believe that the dead come back to visit 
		the living. In these two very different cultures, Professor Rosengren has found a large difference in how children understand 
		death, and has also found that these cultures and their methods of informing children about death have an effect on how adults handle death later on in life.
		This discussion really struck a cord with me, as it may have also with some of the other students. I believe this research is 
		very informative and necessary because it is something that we can all relate to.</p>

		<p> I have the best news of the day! Maybe even of the month! Nicole brought back the two most adorable tiny kittens on earth! One of them will be 
		for my roommate Camille and the other will be for Nicole, but for now they are staying with Nicole so they can stay together for a couple more weeks. 
		They are only about 5 weeks old, and they are just the cutest things! Nicole can't get over how different their personalities are. The striped one is 
		definitely a trouble maker! She is feisty and climbs on anything and everything. The black one is more snuggly. He will just instantly start purring 
		when I pick him up and then fall asleep! But, this day was not only about kittens. I got the chance to skype with my research partner, Erick Odiniyi, 
		and our professor, Jon Brumberg, to talk about our ongoing research from this past academic year. We had an extremely productive talk and my notes from 
		the session can be found in my blog for that project down below. Lastly for this post, our third lab tour was canceled this week because of scheduling 
		issues in the lab, but hopefully it will be rescheduled for a later week that was not filled.</p>
		<!--p>First on the agenda was an inconsistency that Erick found with the amount of audio collected for the 12-24 month range. After using my cleaned 
		transcripts to gather the files, strip the audio from the video if necessary, and chop up the audio into individual utterances using the timestamps 
		on my transcripts, he found that the total time collected for our data sets was in the ballpark of what I calculated from the transcripts except for 
		one. He found almost double the amount of audio for the 12-24 month range using my transcripts than I had calculated, and we have no idea why. So, 
		we will both be looking back at our code to try and find the problem, and hopefully we will solve it quickly. Next on my side, I need to </p-->

		<p> This past weekend, a couple of friends from Lawrence came up to visit and stay with me for the weekend! I took them up to the farmer's market, and 
		over to State Street, and we spent a day in Chicago visiting museums and eating deep dish pizza, and we went swimming on a little tiny beach in Monona. 
		It was really a great time, but it wasn't all play. My friends, Bethany and Roderick, are also my videographers for my upcoming wedding. They wanted to 
		make a video of my fiance, Ethan, and myself talking about love, our relationship, things we hope for in the future, and all that jazz. They wanted to 
		film us both separately while we are apart, so they decided to come up and film me in Madison. There is a bench just out in the backyard in front of 
		a rose bush that they loved, so they plopped me down there and asked me a bunch of questions. They didn't give me any forewarning about their questions 
		so all of my answers felt kind of jumbled and I'm sure I rambled on too much and didn't actually answer some of the questions, but I'm sure they will 
		make a beautiful video. I keep a page on my personal website for the wedding and will post the video there when it is done.</p>
		<p>I was so glad they got to come up! Not just for filming, but to see them again and have some company. It almost felt like they brought a piece of

		<p> It is very strange knowing that I've already spent almost a month here. It's gone by slower than I anticipated, but it is also starting to pick up pace.
		I have outlined three different user models in detail that I want to explore which are explained in my working proposal, and Nicole helped me get access to the
		data I need to start working. It has been a very frustrating process trying to work with an SQL database I don't have any permissions to, but Nicole has been 
        patient with me. Since then I have been able to write some code in R to start sorting through the data and understanding how everything is laid out.
		Unfortunately Nicole had to leave again for another conference this week, but I have plenty to work on now that I have access to data. I also finished writing 
		an outline for the GitHub lit review and need to find time to sit down an write it out. I also sent an email to my research partner, Erick, and our research

		<p> Dr. Marler gave our third faculty presentation, and I really like how she started her presentation. She began by asking us 
		what we wanted to talk about. We had already introduced ourselves, but she wanted to have more of an open discussion instead of a 
		lecture on her research. We asked about how she ended up in Madison, her journey to becoming a professor, about advice for 
		applying to graduate schools, and of course about her research. Her research is focused on the neurobiology of social behavior 
		in animals. She has studied many animals including fish and reptiles, and is currently working with a species of mice that mate 
		with only one partner during their life. She is very interested in the physiological mechanisms that dictate this kind of behavior.
		She has also done some research on testosterone and the reward system that it is used in and its effects in the mysterious sense of 
		location or territory, as well as oxytocin and its effects of group bonding. I really enjoyed her discussions and her advice on 
		graduate school. </p>

		<h5>Second Lab Tour - Rokers' Lab <span class="w3-opacity">June 12, 2018</span></h5>
	  </div>
	  <div class="w3-container">
		<p> Today we had our second lab tour where we visited the Rokers Vision Laboratory. In this lab they research the visual perception of motion and depth. 
		The first thing we did was test our depth perception with some 3D glasses. There were only a couple images I had a hard time identifying, so it 
		seemed like my depth perception was normal. There was one student in our group who couldn't make out any of the images and told us previously that they 
		had very poor depth perception. Part of the reason we did this first was because now the graduate student knew that they would probably have trouble doing 
		the experiments and would possibly feel sick during the last one using the VR head set. He told us that participants who come in a fail this first test 
		are not included in their studies because of these problems. The first study we looked at tested our ability to detect forward and backward motion using 
		special glasses that showed our eyes 2D images. The images shown alternated back and forth between our left and right eyes at specific frequencies. It 
		seemed very much like normal vision, but it took a while to adjust to the experiment because we had to determine if tiny flashing dots from a random point 
		on the screen were coming towards or away from us and it was hard to follow them at first. More information on this specific experiment can be found on 
		their website including the paper they published to the Journal of Vision. The next experiment we looked at was a game of VR Ping-pong! In this experiment 
		we had to watch a ping-pong ball and try to determine where the ball would stop by moving the paddle to that location to intercept it. It was actually 
		fairly difficult because the ball could move in any direction. It was particularly hard to distinguish where it was going when the ball was moving directly 
		towards or away from us.</p>

		<p> If anyone were to ask me how my time has been here in Madison I would most certainly answer "It has been wonderful. It's been an amazing experience and I am so lucky to have 
		had the chance to spend the summer here doing research," and all of that is true, just not all of the time. It has been hard being away from home, and I'm sure that this is true 
		for everyone to some degree who has spent long periods away from their loved ones. What I know is true for me, which may not be true for everyone but I think is endemic in our 
		society today, is that regardless of how I am feeling I dress myself in an attitude of happiness to hide what I am actually feeling. Even if people ask if I am ok and I hint that 
		things could be better or that I'm feeling under the weather, I will still mask it with happiness and optimism. But for once I don't want to have to be happy all the time, and if 
		anyone every actually reads this blog I want them to know that it is ok to struggle and that it is ok to feel something other than happiness. No one should be ashamed of being 
		sad or depressed, but I am. There is always an internal struggle between wanting to just get everything out and find comfort in the people close to me, and not wanting anyone to 
		know that I am struggling and that my work might not be optimal. So I end up closing myself off, and when you are in a new place by yourself closing yourself off from others is 
		one of the worst things you can do. I know that to help myself stay focused and away from depression I need regular contact with people. Even just going into 
		the lab and working next to someone is better than nothing. One thing that is undeniably true is that I am very lucky to know the people that I do here in Madison. These people, 
		being my mentors, the other REU students in the department, the graduate students, and my roommates, mean more to me than they know because they help me find a little peace just 
		by being themselves.</p>
		<p> I guess the one thing that I want to say is that it is normal to be sad during an experience like this. You are away from home and in a new and foreign place. But the sadness 
		can be driven away. We have to let people into our lives that can help us, even if the help comes just from their presence.</p>

	   marching around the market with small bands, dancers, stilt walkers, dragons, traditional drums, and the drum line. It was

	    are probably the most important tables in the database. The database came with a README file 
	    that contains code to restore the database, but when I run the executable ght-restore-mysql it fails. 
	    I have tried several different options to get around this problem like loading individual csv 
	    files into the table (but I don't have access to the file it reads from), changing the secure file privilege 
	    option or secure file location (but I don't have the privilege to change these), adding a new user with more privileges
	    (but I have to have those privileges in order to make a new user with those privileges), and at
	    this point I'm just frustrated and tired of trying to fix this problem. The best part is that

		still be in contact with her while she's gone, but I think she will be too busy to help. So,

	    <h3><b>Faculty Talk No.2</b></h3>
		<h5>Our second faculty presentation by Dr. Schloss <span class="w3-opacity">June 7, 2018</span></h5>
	  </div>
	  <div class="w3-container">
		<p> Dr. Schloss was our second faculty research presentation where she talked about her studies in color inference and visual communication. 
		Her work in visual reasoning focuses on the visuospacial relations in making inferences (specifically with regard to color). How do people 
		infer meaning from color? To begin to answer this question, she starts by explaining some of the different kinds of inferences we can make 
		with regard to color. The first was a judgment about the color itself, ie. how much we like that color. This judgment can be shown to 
		vary with how many things we like that we associate with than color. This gives rise to the color-concept associate space where each object 
		or idea or entity we know has a map of colors that we generally associate with it, and each color has a map of objects that we generally 
		associate with it. And, this space is continually updated with new experiences that we have. The next judgment we can make is about a concept 
		given the color it is associated with as well as other concepts. This is called transmitting. One example that she gave of this was a small 
		test at the very beginning of the session. She showed us three different school sigils, one red, one blue and black, and the other yellow, and 
		she asked us to decide which school we would donate money to. We knew nothing about the schools and just had to pick one. I think all of us 
		picked the sigil that used our favorite color out of the three options, so we were basing our decisions on our color-concept association spaces.
		The last judgment we can make is an assignment. What color best represents a certain concept? This idea is used all the time in color coded systems. 
		One of her studies specifically looked at the best color coding system for garbage and recycling bins. Each bin has a map of colors it is highly 
		associated with, so an intuitive idea is to use the color that is most highly associated with a given product to color its bin. But, there isn't 
		a one-to-one correspondence of colors and concepts, so some products might have the same color. This doesn't help us identify which bin to use when 
		trying to recycle. Her study showed that the best combination of bin colors was the one where colors that correlated highly with several things were 
		used with the bin it correlated with the most, and then the other bins that were highly correlated with this color were given a color that highly 
		negatively correlated with the other bin. For example, both paper and plastic are highly correlated with the color white but paper is the highest

		<p> Today I went on my first lab tour with the PREP students to the Bennett Lab. Professor Bennett does research in Comparative Psychology with animals like apes and monkeys.
		To my surprise, the University of Wisconsin has one of few Primate Research Centers in the country and for part of our lab tour we got to go see Marmoset Monkeys! One fascinating 
		thing I remember learning from the tour was that groups of Marmosets only have one pair of reproductive parents, meaning that all of the group members besides the highest ranking 
		male and female turn off their reproductive processes and the whole group helps to raise the babies. When the babies are first born, they cling onto the back or the neck of the father 
		and are so small that it is almost impossible to spot them. I though it was a truly amazing experience and had never seen anything like it.</p>

	    <h3><b>WEEK TWO</b></h3>
		<h5> Summary of my second week <span class="w3-opacity">May 28 - June 1, 2018</span></h5>
	  </div>
	  <div class="w3-container">
	  <p> This week I read a lot of papers. It was pretty much the only thing I could do since the database on the lab server wasn't ready for me to access yet, 
	  so I participated in our second reading group (paper linked below), I read the Base Challenge project description that Professor Beckage and Professor Austerweil 
	  were given in January, and I was given more papers to read on different mathematical models. The Base Challenge project description contained information about how 
	  the challenge works, what data they are given, the tests that will be used to 'grade' each team's model(s), as well as approximately 30 different questions that 
	  could be asked of the model to predict or explain. My task this week was to narrow down this list of 30 questions to a list of 5-7 that I could focus on in 
	  my model. My questions and focus are explained in my working proposal document which is linked below. Next week may be difficult because both Professor Beckage 
	  and Professor Austerweil will be gone for a portion of it, but we will do the best we can to keep in touch and work on any problems I have with the database.</p>

	    <h3><b>Faculty Talk No.1</b></h3>
		<h5>Our first faculty presentation by Dr. Postle <span class="w3-opacity">May 31, 2018</span></h5>
	  </div>
	  <div class="w3-container">
		<p> Today the PREP students and I had our very first faculty research presentation. The presentation was by Dr. Brad Postle who is also in charge of 
		the PREP program. His talk was about the cognitive neuroscience of visual perception, attention, and working memory. He is interested in our 
		visual working memory and how we make neural connections to form memories. One example he gave of our visual working memory was that of a pro 
		basketball player who first sees his teammate running in front of him, runs past him with the ball, fakes a shot, and passes the ball to his teammate 
		behind him with incredible accuracy. How did he know where his team mate would be? It was with his visual working memory that he could keep track of 
		his location, his teammates relative location, and the relative locations of the players on the other team. It is a lot of information to keep track of 
		and I'm sure the player has had a lot of practice doing it, but it is still amazing when you think about it. Dr. Postle gave us several other examples from 
		his research, one of which was a study where participants judged the angle of movement in an animation while inside an fMRI machine. He and his students 
		found a way for the participant's head to be inside the machine and for them to use their dominant hand to rotate a dial to match the angle they perceived 
		in the animation. They were then able to use the fMRIs and Multivariate Calculus to determine the general location of this process in the brain. It was 
		definitely an amazing study, but one worry that I had was that they did not take into consideration the cost of the process of moving one's hand to 
		rotate the dial. This process is probably mixed in with their results and might skew the activated regions observed by the fMRI.</p>

	  Madison has several different bike paths around the lake and through the city, and there is usually
	  a designated bike lane in all the streets as well. So, today I decided to go up to campus on my bike and look around.
	  I found the Psychology building, the Memorial Union Terrace, and several shops at the East Campus Mall. Above are
	  pictures of some of the buildings around campus and the view from the terrace of lake Mendota.</p>

	  <p> I arrived in Madison Wisconsin at my new home away from home late in the evening on May 18.
	  I spent that first weekend getting situated in the house and getting familiar with my neighborhood, campus, and around the capitol.
	  Madison is so lively and the lake (which is two blocks away from the house) is beautiful.
	  The first day in the lab I met all the graduate students, post-docs, and professors in Professor Austerweil's
	  lab and some of us went out to lunch together. The rest of the week in the lab was spent getting my computer fixed at IT, 
	  downloading software, participating in the lab reading group, and reading papers for my lit review. Overall I think it has been a good first week, and next week I should
	  get more familiar with my project and get connected to the lab server.</p>
