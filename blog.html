		<h5>Sixth Lab Tour - Saffran Lab <span class="w3-opacity">July 10, 2018</span></h5>
	  </div>
	  <div class="w3-container">
		<p> Yes this is technically supposed to be my fifth lab tour, but I missed the fifth one during my week off. So, to stay consistent 
		with the calendar this is the sixth lab tour. And what a marvelous one it was! We went up to the Infant Learning Lab run by Dr. Saffran. 
		In this lab they study how infants, toddlers, and young children learn language. They showed us several studies they conduct where we 
		got to interact with them as the children would. The first was a study looking at how children learn under unexpected conditions and if it 
		is different (possibly more novel, or more confusing) than under expected conditions. To clarify what I mean I will describe the study. Through 
		a video, a child sees a person with two novel objects (made from play dough) on their right and left, the person picks up one of the objects and 
		says something along the lines of "Look at this!" They continuously pick up this same object over and over again for a short time so that the child 
		would grow disinterested in it. Then the objects switch sides. The expected condition is for the person to pick up the same object that is on the opposite 
		side, and the unexpected condition is for them to pick up the other object. They then name the object and later test to see how well the child 
		learned the name of the object that was picked up using eye tracking. So, they are trying to determine if there is a difference between the two 
		learning conditions.</p>
		<p>The second study was about gender in the context of learning. They wish to know if the gender of the speaker influences how quickly children 
		identify objects. They have paired objects that are either colored neutrally in terms of gender, or one object is gendered towards girls and the other 
		towards boys. Then they have a male or female speaker ask the child to identify one of the objects. For the gendered pairs of objects, their hypothesis 
		is that children will find the object faster or before the object name is spoken if the gender of the speaker matches the gender of the object.</p>
		<p> The last study was about learning names of novel objects using priming. In this study, children are shown two pictures on a screen, one known object 
		and one novel object. They are asked to identify one of the objects. Even though they do not know the name of the novel object, since they know the name 
		of the familiar object they can easily identify which object is being asked for. In doing this they learn the names of the novel objects. The researchers 
		specifically pair some of the novel objects with toys and the others with food with the idea that when children learn a new word it will tend to be in 
		the context of words in a similar category. After the training period, originally the researchers asked the children which of the novel objects they could 
		eat. This method came with complications, for instance some children said they could eat both because they were made with play dough. So instead, the 
		researchers turned to a head turning task. The experiment set up included three different screens, a center, left, and right screen. The child would sit and 
		face the center screen watching an animated image. The image would then move to either the left or right screen and two words would be repeated. When the child 
		gets bored of the two words they turn their head away, and the image goes back to the center screen. The image would then move to the opposite screen and two 
		other words would be repeated. This method is repeated for about ten minutes, and the duration of one set of words is dictated by the child's interest in those 
		words (or their novelty). The idea is that two words like 'dog' and 'cat' said together will not hold a child's attention as long as two words that are not of 
		the same category like 'dog' and 'shoe'. This is how the researchers tested if the priming effect of grouped images in the first part of the study allowed the 
		children to learn those objects and group them in the same category as the other images they were presented with. I was skeptical at first that a child 
		would be able to pick up on this pattern because I didn't notice it myself, but the students assured me that children are much better at recognizing these 
		kinds of patterns than adults are and that their experiment has been successful in finding this behavioral effect. One of the reasonings behind this 
		is that children are more imaginative and more able to use the context of their surroundings to define or understand an object. </p>
		<p>If you can't tell I am extremely interested in these sorts of studies and I really enjoyed this lab tour. I am just utterly fascinated with the way children 
		learn language. They are just tiny little machines that aren't good at anything else except learning language. It is amazing to me, and I feel that even tiny 
		steps towards understanding how children are able to do this so easily will dramatically increase our knowledge of the brain and its structures as well as 
		improve our techniques of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. I think this would definitely be a feasible option for me as I look for graduate 
		schools and research opportunities.</p>

	  <div class="w3-container">
		<p> Today our fourth faculty presentation was given by Dr. Rosengren who is a lifespan developmental psychologist. Dr. 
		Rosengren began his discussion talking about his interesting journey through academia. He and his wife were originally both 
		professors, but his wife took a job within the administration at their first university (University of Minnesota if I am 
		remembering correctly). As his wife took jobs at different universities over the years, he was able to follow her and find 
		a place in every department he found himself in. He mentioned that in order to dispel any assumptions that he only got the 
		job because of his wife's position, Dr. Rosengren worked twice as hard as he needed to and proved his worth to the community 
		every single time. I really appreciated his story because it is not one that people see every day. He told us he felt it 
		important to use himself as an example because, even though we might want it to be, the road to (and through) academia is not 
		always a straight line. </p>
		<p> Professor Rosengren also told us about his research in child cognitive development. He is very interested in answering 
		questions like 'How do children think about the world?', 'How do they differentiate between the real world and fantasy?', 'What kinds of things do children believe are magical?',
		'How do children understand death?', 'How do parents communicate with their children about death?'. We spent quite a bit of 
		time in our discussion about how children understand death and how their culture and environment shapes their perspective on 
		death. Specifically, Rosengren has studied the difference between how Americans generally view death and how Mexicans view death.
		In America it is very common to shield children from death, especially the death of a family member, and often families do not 
		teach their children about death with the worry that it will scare them or that they will not be able to understand. On the 
		other hand, in Mexico it is common for families to talk about death. The Dia de Muertos (Day of the Dead) is a holiday beginning October 31 
		that is celebrated throughout Mexico. It is a celebration of those who have died, where the people believe that the dead come back to visit 
		the living. In these two very different cultures, Professor Rosengren has found a large difference in how children understand 
		death, and has also found that these cultures and their methods of informing children about death have an effect on how adults handle death later on in life.
		This discussion really struck a cord with me, as it may have also with some of the other students. I believe this research is 
		very informative and necessary because it is something that we can all relate to.</p>

		<p> I have the best news of the day! Maybe even of the month! Nicole brought back the two most adorable tiny kittens on earth! One of them will be 
		for my roommate Camille and the other will be for Nicole, but for now they are staying with Nicole so they can stay together for a couple more weeks. 
		They are only about 5 weeks old, and they are just the cutest things! Nicole can't get over how different their personalities are. The striped one is 
		definitely a trouble maker! She is feisty and climbs on anything and everything. The black one is more snuggly. He will just instantly start purring 
		when I pick him up and then fall asleep! But, this day was not only about kittens. I got the chance to skype with my research partner, Erick Odiniyi, 
		and our professor, Jon Brumberg, to talk about our ongoing research from this past academic year. We had an extremely productive talk and my notes from 
		the session can be found in my blog for that project down below. Lastly for this post, our third lab tour was canceled this week because of scheduling 
		issues in the lab, but hopefully it will be rescheduled for a later week that was not filled.</p>
		<!--p>First on the agenda was an inconsistency that Erick found with the amount of audio collected for the 12-24 month range. After using my cleaned 
		transcripts to gather the files, strip the audio from the video if necessary, and chop up the audio into individual utterances using the timestamps 
		on my transcripts, he found that the total time collected for our data sets was in the ballpark of what I calculated from the transcripts except for 
		one. He found almost double the amount of audio for the 12-24 month range using my transcripts than I had calculated, and we have no idea why. So, 
		we will both be looking back at our code to try and find the problem, and hopefully we will solve it quickly. Next on my side, I need to </p-->

		<p> This past weekend, a couple of friends from Lawrence came up to visit and stay with me for the weekend! I took them up to the farmer's market, and 
		over to State Street, and we spent a day in Chicago visiting museums and eating deep dish pizza, and we went swimming on a little tiny beach in Monona. 
		It was really a great time, but it wasn't all play. My friends, Bethany and Roderick, are also my videographers for my upcoming wedding. They wanted to 
		make a video of my fiance, Ethan, and myself talking about love, our relationship, things we hope for in the future, and all that jazz. They wanted to 
		film us both separately while we are apart, so they decided to come up and film me in Madison. There is a bench just out in the backyard in front of 
		a rose bush that they loved, so they plopped me down there and asked me a bunch of questions. They didn't give me any forewarning about their questions 
		so all of my answers felt kind of jumbled and I'm sure I rambled on too much and didn't actually answer some of the questions, but I'm sure they will 
		make a beautiful video. I keep a page on my personal website for the wedding and will post the video there when it is done.</p>
		<p>I was so glad they got to come up! Not just for filming, but to see them again and have some company. It almost felt like they brought a piece of 
		home with them, and a piece of Ethan. It was hard watching them leave, but I know it had to come sooner rather than later.</p>

		<p> It is very strange knowing that I've already spent almost a month here. It's gone by slower than I anticipated, but it is also starting to pick up pace.
		I have outlined three different user models in detail that I want to explore which are explained in my working proposal, and Nicole helped me get access to the
		data I need to start working. It has been a very frustrating process trying to work with an SQL database I don't have any permissions to, but Nicole has been 
        patient with me. Since then I have been able to write some code in R to start sorting through the data and understanding how everything is laid out.
		Unfortunately Nicole had to leave again for another conference this week, but I have plenty to work on now that I have access to data. I also finished writing 
		an outline for the GitHub lit review and need to find time to sit down an write it out. I also sent an email to my research partner, Erick, and our research 
		professor, Professor Brumberg, about finding a time to skype and discuss our ongoing research at KU which is documented on my personal website linked below.</p>

	  <div class="w3-container">
		<p> Dr. Marler gave our third faculty presentation, and I really like how she started her presentation. She began by asking us 
		what we wanted to talk about. We had already introduced ourselves, but she wanted to have more of an open discussion instead of a 
		lecture on her research. We asked about how she ended up in Madison, her journey to becoming a professor, about advice for 
		applying to graduate schools, and of course about her research. Her research is focused on the neurobiology of social behavior 
		in animals. She has studied many animals including fish and reptiles, and is currently working with a species of mice that mate 
		with only one partner during their life. She is very interested in the physiological mechanisms that dictate this kind of behavior.
		She has also done some research on testosterone and the reward system that it is used in and its effects in the mysterious sense of 
		location or territory, as well as oxytocin and its effects of group bonding. I really enjoyed her discussions and her advice on 
		graduate school. </p>

		<h5>Second Lab Tour - Rokers' Lab <span class="w3-opacity">June 12, 2018</span></h5>
	  </div>
	  <div class="w3-container">
		<p> Today we had our second lab tour where we visited the Rokers Vision Laboratory. In this lab they research the visual perception of motion and depth. 
		The first thing we did was test our depth perception with some 3D glasses. There were only a couple images I had a hard time identifying, so it 
		seemed like my depth perception was normal. There was one student in our group who couldn't make out any of the images and told us previously that they 
		had very poor depth perception. Part of the reason we did this first was because now the graduate student knew that they would probably have trouble doing 
		the experiments and would possibly feel sick during the last one using the VR head set. He told us that participants who come in a fail this first test 
		are not included in their studies because of these problems. The first study we looked at tested our ability to detect forward and backward motion using 
		special glasses that showed our eyes 2D images. The images shown alternated back and forth between our left and right eyes at specific frequencies. It 
		seemed very much like normal vision, but it took a while to adjust to the experiment because we had to determine if tiny flashing dots from a random point 
		on the screen were coming towards or away from us and it was hard to follow them at first. More information on this specific experiment can be found on 
		their website including the paper they published to the Journal of Vision. The next experiment we looked at was a game of VR Ping-pong! In this experiment 
		we had to watch a ping-pong ball and try to determine where the ball would stop by moving the paddle to that location to intercept it. It was actually 
		fairly difficult because the ball could move in any direction. It was particularly hard to distinguish where it was going when the ball was moving directly 
		towards or away from us.</p>

		<p> If anyone were to ask me how my time has been here in Madison I would most certainly answer "It has been wonderful. It's been an amazing experience and I am so lucky to have 
		had the chance to spend the summer here doing research," and all of that is true, just not all of the time. It has been hard being away from home, and I'm sure that this is true 
		for everyone to some degree who has spent long periods away from their loved ones. What I know is true for me, which may not be true for everyone but I think is endemic in our 
		society today, is that regardless of how I am feeling I dress myself in an attitude of happiness to hide what I am actually feeling. Even if people ask if I am ok and I hint that 
		things could be better or that I'm feeling under the weather, I will still mask it with happiness and optimism. But for once I don't want to have to be happy all the time, and if 
		anyone every actually reads this blog I want them to know that it is ok to struggle and that it is ok to feel something other than happiness. No one should be ashamed of being 
		sad or depressed, but I am. There is always an internal struggle between wanting to just get everything out and find comfort in the people close to me, and not wanting anyone to 
		know that I am struggling and that my work might not be optimal. So I end up closing myself off, and when you are in a new place by yourself closing yourself off from others is 
		one of the worst things you can do. I know that to help myself stay focused and away from depression I need regular contact with people. Even just going into 
		the lab and working next to someone is better than nothing. One thing that is undeniably true is that I am very lucky to know the people that I do here in Madison. These people, 
		being my mentors, the other REU students in the department, the graduate students, and my roommates, mean more to me than they know because they help me find a little peace just 
		by being themselves.</p>
		<p> I guess the one thing that I want to say is that it is normal to be sad during an experience like this. You are away from home and in a new and foreign place. But the sadness 
		can be driven away. We have to let people into our lives that can help us, even if the help comes just from their presence.</p>

	  <p> The very first full day I was in Madison, Professor Beckage took me up to the Dane County Farmers' Market. I have been told 
	   that it is one of the largest farmers' markets in the country and encircles Capitol Square. I go every Saturday to pick up 
	   fresh vegetables, bread, jam, honey, and sometimes gifts to take back home to my friends and family in Lawrence. 
	   But this Saturday was a bit different. It was still just as busy as usual, but there was a drum line playing 
	   on one corner, circus performers in another corner, a magician in another, and then a small but energetic parade 
	   marching around the market with small bands, dancers, stilt walkers, dragons, traditional drums, and the drum line. It was

	    <p> This week has been at least semi-productive. I am now able to access the mysql database 
	    on the lab server which contains one month of the GHTorrent data. I am able to look through 
	    the tables and make queries on the data but I noticed that not all of the tables contained the 
	    data they were supposed to. Particularly the user and repositories tables were empty, and those 
	    are probably the most important tables in the database. The database came with a README file 
	    that contains code to restore the database, but when I run the executable ght-restore-mysql it fails. 
	    I have tried several different options to get around this problem like loading individual csv 
	    files into the table (but I don't have access to the file it reads from), changing the secure file privilege 
	    option or secure file location (but I don't have the privilege to change these), adding a new user with more privileges
	    (but I have to have those privileges in order to make a new user with those privileges), and at
	    this point I'm just frustrated and tired of trying to fix this problem. The best part is that
		Professor Beckage left for a conference yesterday and won't be back until Sunday night. I will 
		still be in contact with her while she's gone, but I think she will be too busy to help. So, 
		I will just keep reading papers and working on my proposal.</p>

	    <h3><b>Faculty Talk No.2</b></h3>
		<h5>Our second faculty presentation by Dr. Schloss <span class="w3-opacity">June 7, 2018</span></h5>
	  </div>
	  <div class="w3-container">
		<p> Dr. Schloss was our second faculty research presentation where she talked about her studies in color inference and visual communication. 
		Her work in visual reasoning focuses on the visuospacial relations in making inferences (specifically with regard to color). How do people 
		infer meaning from color? To begin to answer this question, she starts by explaining some of the different kinds of inferences we can make 
		with regard to color. The first was a judgment about the color itself, ie. how much we like that color. This judgment can be shown to 
		vary with how many things we like that we associate with than color. This gives rise to the color-concept associate space where each object 
		or idea or entity we know has a map of colors that we generally associate with it, and each color has a map of objects that we generally 
		associate with it. And, this space is continually updated with new experiences that we have. The next judgment we can make is about a concept 
		given the color it is associated with as well as other concepts. This is called transmitting. One example that she gave of this was a small 
		test at the very beginning of the session. She showed us three different school sigils, one red, one blue and black, and the other yellow, and 
		she asked us to decide which school we would donate money to. We knew nothing about the schools and just had to pick one. I think all of us 
		picked the sigil that used our favorite color out of the three options, so we were basing our decisions on our color-concept association spaces.
		The last judgment we can make is an assignment. What color best represents a certain concept? This idea is used all the time in color coded systems. 
		One of her studies specifically looked at the best color coding system for garbage and recycling bins. Each bin has a map of colors it is highly 
		associated with, so an intuitive idea is to use the color that is most highly associated with a given product to color its bin. But, there isn't 
		a one-to-one correspondence of colors and concepts, so some products might have the same color. This doesn't help us identify which bin to use when 
		trying to recycle. Her study showed that the best combination of bin colors was the one where colors that correlated highly with several things were 
		used with the bin it correlated with the most, and then the other bins that were highly correlated with this color were given a color that highly 
		negatively correlated with the other bin. For example, both paper and plastic are highly correlated with the color white but paper is the highest 
		correlate. So, the paper bin would be colored white. Now a highly negative correlate of paper was the color red, so the plastic bin would be 
		colored red. This kind of research is very intriguing and has many applications to marketing and advertising. </p>

		<p> Today I went on my first lab tour with the PREP students to the Bennett Lab. Professor Bennett does research in Comparative Psychology with animals like apes and monkeys.
		To my surprise, the University of Wisconsin has one of few Primate Research Centers in the country and for part of our lab tour we got to go see Marmoset Monkeys! One fascinating 
		thing I remember learning from the tour was that groups of Marmosets only have one pair of reproductive parents, meaning that all of the group members besides the highest ranking 
		male and female turn off their reproductive processes and the whole group helps to raise the babies. When the babies are first born, they cling onto the back or the neck of the father 
		and are so small that it is almost impossible to spot them. I though it was a truly amazing experience and had never seen anything like it.</p>

	  the challenge works, what data they are given, the tests that will be used to 'grade' each team's model(s), as well as approximately 30 different questions that 
	  could be asked of the model to predict or explain. My task this week was to narrow down this list of 30 questions to a list of 5-7 that I could focus on in 
	  my model. My questions and focus are explained in my working proposal document which is linked below. Next week may be difficult because both Professor Beckage 
	  and Professor Austerweil will be gone for a portion of it, but we will do the best we can to keep in touch and work on any problems I have with the database.</p>

	    <h3><b>Faculty Talk No.1</b></h3>
		<h5>Our first faculty presentation by Dr. Postle <span class="w3-opacity">May 31, 2018</span></h5>
	  </div>
	  <div class="w3-container">
		<p> Today the PREP students and I had our very first faculty research presentation. The presentation was by Dr. Brad Postle who is also in charge of 
		the PREP program. His talk was about the cognitive neuroscience of visual perception, attention, and working memory. He is interested in our 
		visual working memory and how we make neural connections to form memories. One example he gave of our visual working memory was that of a pro 
		basketball player who first sees his teammate running in front of him, runs past him with the ball, fakes a shot, and passes the ball to his teammate 
		behind him with incredible accuracy. How did he know where his team mate would be? It was with his visual working memory that he could keep track of 
		his location, his teammates relative location, and the relative locations of the players on the other team. It is a lot of information to keep track of 
		and I'm sure the player has had a lot of practice doing it, but it is still amazing when you think about it. Dr. Postle gave us several other examples from 
		his research, one of which was a study where participants judged the angle of movement in an animation while inside an fMRI machine. He and his students 
		found a way for the participant's head to be inside the machine and for them to use their dominant hand to rotate a dial to match the angle they perceived 
		in the animation. They were then able to use the fMRIs and Multivariate Calculus to determine the general location of this process in the brain. It was 
		definitely an amazing study, but one worry that I had was that they did not take into consideration the cost of the process of moving one's hand to 
		rotate the dial. This process is probably mixed in with their results and might skew the activated regions observed by the fMRI.</p>

	  <p> I am so glad that I was able to bring my bike with me up to Madison. It is so easy to get around!
	  Madison has several different bike paths around the lake and through the city, and there is usually
	  a designated bike lane in all the streets as well. So, today I decided to go up to campus on my bike and look around.
	  I found the Psychology building, the Memorial Union Terrace, and several shops at the East Campus Mall. Above are
	  pictures of some of the buildings around campus and the view from the terrace of lake Mendota.</p>

	  <p> I arrived in Madison Wisconsin at my new home away from home late in the evening on May 18.
	  I spent that first weekend getting situated in the house and getting familiar with my neighborhood, campus, and around the capitol.
	  Madison is so lively and the lake (which is two blocks away from the house) is beautiful.
	  The first day in the lab I met all the graduate students, post-docs, and professors in Professor Austerweil's
	  lab and some of us went out to lunch together. The rest of the week in the lab was spent getting my computer fixed at IT, 
	  downloading software, participating in the lab reading group, and reading papers for my lit review. Overall I think it has been a good first week, and next week I should
	  get more familiar with my project and get connected to the lab server.</p>
