	  <p> The very first full day I was in Madison, Professor Beckage took me up to the Dane County Farmers' Market. I have been told 
	   that it is one of the largest farmers' markets in the country and encircles Capitol Square. I go every Saturday to pick up 
	   fresh vegetables, bread, jam, honey, and sometimes gifts to take back home to my friends and family in Lawrence. 
	   But this Saturday was a bit different. It was still just as busy as usual, but there was a drum line playing 
	   on one corner, circus performers in another corner, a magician in another, and then a small but energetic parade 
	   marching around the market with small bands, dancers, stilt walkers, dragons, traditional drums, and the drum line. It was 
	   really a pleasent surprise. I met some of the PREP students there a little after the parade was finished and they were also 
	   impressed with the parade and the amazing community we have the opportunity to live with for a short while.</p>

		<h5> Summary of my third week <span class="w3-opacity">June 4 - 8, 2018</span></h5>

	  <div class="w3-container">
	    <p> This week has been at least semi-productive. I am now able to access the mysql database 
	    on the lab server which contains one month of the GHTorrent data. I am able to look through 
	    the tables and make queries on the data but I noticed that not all of the tables contained the 
	    data they were supposed to. Particularly the user and repositories tables were empty, and those 
	    are probably the most important tables in the database. The database came with a README file 
	    that contains code to restore the database, but when I run the executable ght-restore-mysql it fails. 
	    I have tried several different options to get around this problem like loading individual csv 
	    files into the table (but I don't have access to the file it reads from), changing the secure file privilege 
	    option or secure file location (but I don't have the privilege to change these), adding a new user with more privileges
	    (but I have to have those privileges in order to make a new user with those privileges), and at
	    this point I'm just frustrated and tired of trying to fix this problem. The best part is that
		Professor Beckage left for a conference yesterday and won't be back until Sunday night. I will 
		still be in contact with her while she's gone, but I think she will be too busy to help. So, 
		I will just keep reading papers and working on my proposal.</p>

		<p> Today I went on my first lab tour with the PREP students to the Bennett Lab. Professor Bennett does research in Comparitive Psychology with animals like apes and monkeys.
		To my surprise, the Universtiy of Wisconsin has one of few Primate Research Centers in the country and for part of our lab tour we got to go see Marmoset Monkeys! One facsinating 
		thing I remember learning from the tour was that groups of Marmosets only have one pair of reproductive parents, meaning that all of the group members besides the highest ranking 
		male and female turn off their reproductive processes and the whole group helps to raise the babies. When the babies are first born, they cling onto the back or the neck of the father 
		and are so small that it is almost impossible to spot them. I though it was a truly amazing experience and had never seen anything like it.</p>

	  <div class="w3-container">
	  <p> This week I read a lot of papers. It was pretty much the only thing I could do since the database on the lab server wasn't ready for me to access yet, 
	  so I participated in our second reading group (paper linked below), I read the Base Challenge project description that Professor Beckage and Professor Austerweil 
	  were given in January, and I was given more papers to read on different mathematical models. The Base Challenge project description contained information about how 
	  the challenge works, what data they are given, the tests that will be used to 'grade' each team's model(s), as well as approximately 30 different questions that 
	  could be asked of the model to predict or exaplain. My task this week was to narrow down this list of 30 questions to a list of 5-7 that I could focus on in 
	  my model. My questions and focus are explained in my working proposal document which is linked below. Next week may be difficult because both Professor Beckage 
	  and Professor Austerweil will be gone for a portion of it, but we will do the best we can to keep in touch and work on any problems I have with the database.</p>

	  I spent that first weekend getting situated in the house and getting familiar with my neighboorhood, campus, and around the capitol.
	  Madison is so lively and the lake (which is two blocks away from the house) is beautiful.
	  The first day in the lab I met all the graduate students, post-docs, and professors in Professor Austerweil's
	  lab and some of us went out to lunch together. The rest of the week in the lab was spent getting my computer fixed at IT, 
	  downloading software, participating in the lab reading group, and reading papers for my lit review. Overall I think it has been a good first week, and next week I should
	  get more familiar with my project and get connected to the lab server.</p>
